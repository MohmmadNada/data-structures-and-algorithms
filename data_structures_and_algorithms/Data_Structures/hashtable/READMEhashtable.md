# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:
1. add 
2. get 
3. contains 
4. hash 
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. add : time Big(1) , space Big(1)
2. get : time Big(1) , space Big(1)
3. contains : time Big(1) , space Big(1)
4. hash : time Big(1) , space Big(1)
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
1. add : add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
2. get : return Value associated with that key in the table
3. contains : Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

4. hash :Returns: Index in the collection for that key
