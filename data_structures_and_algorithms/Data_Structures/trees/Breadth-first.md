# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
add method in Binart tree ,by using Breadth-first approach traverse all nodesand Return list of all values in the tree,

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
use to array one for final result and one as temp nodes 
loop throgh and remove parent from array(temp) and add the childs   
space : Big O(n) array depands on umbers of nodes in tree
time : Big O(n): loop throght all nodes
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
