 Algorithem
* def function with one argument 
* def empty array (return array )
* loop with range equal array length 
* insert last element in new array as first element (index = lenght -1-i)
* return new(reverse ) array 
* call feunc 

about time is space , its linear relation, depand only in array lenght so , long array mean more space and time
