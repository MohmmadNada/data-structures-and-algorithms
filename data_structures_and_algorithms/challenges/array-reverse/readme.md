 Algorithem
* def function with one argument(array) 
* def reverse array equal input array
* loop with range equal array length -1
* reasign first element in new array as last element from input array 
* return new(reverse ) array 
* call feunc 

about time is space , its linear relation, depand only in array lenght so , long array mean more space and time
