# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Quick Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
### Efficency
Time: O(n log n )

Space: O(1)
    * No additional space is being created. This array is being sorted in placeâ€¦keeping the space at constant O(1).
